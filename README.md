# What you need

![Alt text](/doc/IMAG0607a.jpg?raw=true "Parts")

You need:

1. A USB LED Light
   You can find these from Internet sellers, eg. [Bangood]([I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)) currently have them for less than 50p if you buy 3 or more.

2. An XC6206 3.3V regulator
   The SOT-89 package, eg. these for 10 cents each from [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/20pcs-lot-XC6206P332PR-XC6206P332-XC6206-3-3V-SOT-89/32701818048.html)

3. An ESP-12S

   This **must** be the "S" version of the ESP-12. The "S" version has built-in pull-up/down resistors and bypass capacitors. Eg. these for £1.89 on [EBay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/New-ESP8266-ESP-12S-Serial-Wireless-WIFI-Transceiver-Sender-Receiver-LWIP-AP-STA-/291971729155)
